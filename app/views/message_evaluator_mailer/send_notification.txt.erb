in order to fill your assigned evaluations of projects. You find them under your personal tab. Notice that all the projects are as well available out of your tab.

Thank you for doing this crucial work for CIMPA before 15th of November. Recall that the meeting will begin in Paris at IHP, room 01, 27th of November at 15h.

Once you open a project you will find your evaluation tab at its top.

If for some reason (like conflict of interest or orthogonal expertise) you prefer not to evaluate a project please contact Marisa marisa.fernandez@ehu.es and Enrique zuazua@bcamath.org with a copy to Agnès. A suggestion of another evaluator is welcomed.

We recall that you are free to consult the Director of CIMPA, the Scientific Officers of CIMPA or any other appropriate colleague. You can mention their advice without citing their names. Everything is intended to be anonymous after your work.

We are looking forward.  This new procedure should help a lot after a while; it corresponds to your suggestion one year ago. We have done our best but difficulties can appear. If so please contact Alfonso Pérez (IT responsible) webmaster@cimpa.info , Agnès Gomez (cimpa@unice.fr) and Claude Cibils (Claude.Cibils@gmail.com). We apologize in advance.


Best regards,
Enrique Zuazua – President of the SC of CIMPA
Marisa Fernandez – Secretary of the SC of CIMPA
Claude Cibils – Director of CIMPA
